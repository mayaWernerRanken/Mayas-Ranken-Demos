# Maya's Ranken Demos

Good evening! My name is Maya, I'm a student at Ranken Technical College and I'm majoring in IT.
I made this list for myself so I could keep track of any exercises I write in C#, but you're always welcome to clone and check my demos out, whether for studying various functions or just as a cheat sheet, I don't care :)
